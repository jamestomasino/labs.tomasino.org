While at [Empathy Lab][], I was used as a resource on a lot of different
projects per week. Sometimes my project managers didn't realize how much
they were booking me and I needed to illustrate it for them. This
interface grew out of that.

At one time I had thought of expanding it and hooking it directly into
our time management system rather than a manual XML file, but it never
came to be. Still, it was fun to design. There's even a little scroll
wheel functionality in there!
