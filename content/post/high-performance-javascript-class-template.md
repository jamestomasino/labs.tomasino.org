This is a post more for my own future reference than the rest of the
world:

I posted earlier with my [standard JavaScript class template][]. While I
favor that one for reasons of encapsulation, its performance is really
not very optimized. Here is an alternate class template I use in cases
where performance (or the quantity of objects) is more important.

Most of this layout was lifted from [iScroll][]. I've kept a lot of
iScroll's configuration settings as well. You'll see those up near the
top.
