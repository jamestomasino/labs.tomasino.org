I was just reading [a blog
post](https://acrossapp.com/blog/how-a-2-person-startup-already-uses-28-other-tools)
about a two-person startup using 28 various tools and services,
and the costs associated with those. It made me wonder what I am
using that's a product or service of others and what I'm spending
on it. Let's start a list and see.

## Software

This first batch of services and software deals with replacements
for the typical workflow tools I used at a full time agency. I'm
no longer on a Mac, but rather on Ubuntu, so the software choices
have changed quite a bit. Thankfully I've been able to find free
replacements in most cases.

- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (free) - Microsoft
  Office replacement
- [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/is/) (free) - Premiere
  replacement, cross-platform. I also have kdenlive (free)
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (free) - Adobe
  Audition replacement, cross-platform
- [Master PDF Editor](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/)
  (v5, one-time $49.97) - This lets me do all the fancy Adobe Acrobat stuff
- [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) (free) - InDesign / Page
  Layout replacement. It won't open INDD files, though, which is frustrating.
- [Sky](https://www.tel.red/linux.php) ($50/year) - This was
  intended to be my Lync / Skype for Business replacement. I don't
  actually use the chat, but it was supposed to let me connect to
  the conference calls. It has rarely worked and I will not be
  renewing it.
- [vim](https://vim.org) (free) - everything text, code, notes,
  invoicing, etc

## Web Services

Beyond the locally installed software, my business involves a lot
of web services. Some are software replacements and others tools
for developing client work, hosting, or communicating.

- [Photopea](https://photopea.com) ($40/year) - This is my
  Photoshop & Sketch replacement app.
- [Vectr](https://vectr.com) (free) - Vector art, Illustrator
  replacement
- [GitHub](https://github.com) ($84/year) - Version control
  / source management
- [Vultr](https://vultr.com) ($324/year) - Virtual Private Server
  hosting for all my personal and business web properties. This
  includes hobby projects which aren't really part of my business
  expenses, but the hosting crosses boundaries, so I've included
  it all.
- [Namesilo.com](https://namesilo.com) ($166.74/year)- DNS
  provider for most of my domains.
- [ISNIC](https://isnic.is) ($100/year) - Icelandic (.is) domains.
- [Harmonizely](https://harmonizely.com) ($120/year) - Meeting
  scheduling and calendar integration.
- [EmailOnAcid](https://emailonacid.com) ($528.00/year) - Email
  testing suite. I've had a lot of email work this year and this
  service is invaluable in checking the rendering across devices.
  I was previously using Litmus, but the pricing model is easier
  with EmailOnAcid.
- [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) ($76/year) - This is the best
  overall mail service I use, and the only one I pay for. It
  handles professional and personal mail via custom domains,
  offers me all the security I need, and integrates with
  everything. I also use Tutanota, Protonmail, Lavabit, RiseUp,
  and I have a G-Apps account for a specific engagement as well.
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) (free) - Video conferencing and phone
  bridge lines.
- [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) (free) - Transactional & API
  driven emails.
- [Skype](https://skype.com) ($43.08/year) - Paid service for
  calling US numbers. This is redundant with my Flowroute
  subscription, but has more reliable connectivity.
- [Flowroute](https://flowroute.com) ($16.92/year) - I converted
  my US-based cell phone number to a SIP line via this service.
  I access it with Zoiper on my computer and can receive and make
  US calls. I also have wired up a web service to handle SMS
  messages and forward them to my email. The quality is good, but
  occasionally I get drop-offs or have audio issues on long calls.
  As a result, I still have Skype as well.
- [Pagekite](https://pagekite.net) ($36/year) - localhost tunneling
  service. I use this wonderful project for tossing up staging
  environments of my in-progress work for client reviews.

**2019 Total:** $1534.71

I expect to shave around $100 off that in 2020. I'd love to be
able to cancel EmailOnAcid, but as long as the marketing email
builds keep coming in, it pays for itself quickly.

## Home expenses

Since I work from home, you could legitimately consider my utility
bills a part of that budget. Rent aside, I have gigabit internet
service and unlimited cellphone data for a pittance. Our
electricity costs are almost zero and there's no other measurable
utility costs.

I had a vague sense of these costs before but I don't think
I realized just how much it adds up to. This is a good thing to
keep in mind for the future. Maybe I'll hold off on buying
needless domains in 2020 (fat chance).

How about you? What sort of spending do you do on this stuff?
