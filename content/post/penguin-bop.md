This AS2 project was part of an application to [Moxie Interactive][]
back in 2007. There was talk back then of designing Wii games in Flash,
so I took it upon myself to style up a fake little "game" and send it in
with my portfolio & resume.

The penguins eyes follow the mouse and can be bop'd on the head or poked
from below. Hitting them from below will cause them to make a penguin
noise--at least what I assume a penguin noise would be. I tried to
squawk in the key of C so they make a bit of a scale. One could,
theoretically, make them sing a song.

And yes, that's my voice squawking.
