![Ada Lovelace](https://labs.tomasino.org/assets/images/ada-lovelace.jpg)

In college I had some brief exposure to the programming language,
[Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)). At the
time I was learning C and it didn't capture much interest for me. Then
a whole bunch of life happened wherein I left computer science and ended
up playing in the realm of front-end languages for most of my career. Now
as I look into my toolbox of programming skills I see a deficit directly
in the spot where Ada could go.

What is Ada? It's a highly structured language built for large codebases
with a focus on safety and reliability. There's a ton of research behind
its methodologies and history with the US government that's worth a read.
I'm equally fascinated with its background as I am with the woman whose
name in bears, Ada Lovelace. She's also worth reading up on.

Why Ada? Rust or Golang are incredibly popular these days as
C replacements. Ada gets almost no mention or love in online communities.
It's the tool of avionics and of the military, right? Why would I need it?

In short, I don't. I'm perfectly fine trucking along with JavaScript, PHP,
Python, and shell scripts. Unfortunately for me, Ada has gotten stuck in
my head and won't let go.

So I'm learning it properly now. I've already started [doing some
exercises](https://github.com/jamestomasino/ada-practice), and I'm reading
through some [impressive
tutorials](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada). The squatters
in the #ada IRC room on freenode also recommended a book by John Barnes
called [Programming in Ada
2012](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ada-2012-John-Barnes/dp/110742481X)
as the best resource. So with all that together and some patience I'm
going to build some silly things and practice. If anything of note comes
up I'll share it here.
