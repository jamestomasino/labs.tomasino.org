title: HTML5 - Ready or not?

A lot of folks have been raving about HTML5 lately and I've been a
little behind on writing about it, especially being that I'm a Flash
developer and it is being touted as a "Flash killer". I'll keep this
short and not ranty, but there's a few things I want to discuss.

1.  HTML5's feature set, even when you consider new abilities that are
    still experimental, is not even remotely close to what modern
    Actionscript programming has to offer. The days when Flash was just
    good for banner ads and website intros has long since passed. If
    you're not already familiar, take a look [here][], or [here][1]Â to
    see what I'm talking about. Talking about it as a Flash killer is
    really quite silly. If anything, HTML5 will encroach on Flash at
    simple interactive experiences, basic video, and "Web 2.0" ui.
    Flash, meanwhile, will be moving deeper into developing full
    applications and insane experiences. This is all good. Everyone
    should be happy. YAY!
2.  HTML5 has a lot of claims about what it can do, but the dirty little
    secret is that like previous versions of HTML, the major browsers
    have decided to implement the standard differently. Things that
    should be consistent are not. The best example of this is the HTM5
    video object, which is supported badly, with lots of bugs (that vary
    from browser to browser), and supporting different video types in
    each browser. These issues are extensive still because HTML5 is
    still evolving. It's not a fast process at all, and will be years
    before we can safely use the features that are currently defined,
    let alone the new concepts on the horizon.

Here are two very important links for HTML5. These are instrumental
references for developers, and really good info for the rest of the
world:

[html5please.us][] - This shows the major new features in HTML5 and
CSS3, along with a description of whether they are currently safe to
implement alone, with some extra JS code, with caveats or fallbacks, or
not at all.

[caniuse.com][] - This site goes into more depth. Feature by feature it
shows which browsers and versions are supported fully or partially.
