I have unilaterally decided that the planets of our solar system have different
days of the week than Earth. Why? Because I accidentally said, "It's always
Friday somewhere," instead of "It's always 5:00 somewhere." Oops.

So what are the days of the week? I decided each planet should be offset from
our own day of the week by one day per planet. But which way should they shift?
Should Mars always be one day in the future or in the past?

Then it hit me! Planets closer to the Sun should be one day closer to Sunday.
Planets further from the Sun should be one day further from Sunday!

This means, of course, that the direction of the days of the week changes
whether it's Monday-Wed or Thurs-Sat on Earth. How fun!

Here's a chart!

But what happens when it's Sunday on Earth?

Imagination.
