The search engine has been the de facto method of online discovery since before
the web was fully established.
[Archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_(search_engine)) helped us search
FTP, and [Veronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_(search_engine))
spidered through Gopher to pave the way for 1994's first full-text web search,
[WebCrawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCrawler). It wasn't until the late
nineties when the algorithmic searches of
[AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista),
[Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos), and
[Excite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excite_(web_portal)) really popularized
their use over [blogrolls](https://blogroll.org/what-are-blogrolls/) and [web
directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_directory). By the time Google
came on the scene with PageRank their trajectory was set.

For over 20 years the model has persisted. Improve rankings, improve search, and
further entrench yourself at the heart of the web experience. It is this central
position in experience that drives the Google revenue engine. Advertisers pay
Google to reach customers in search because that's where the customers are.
Marketing teams build their sites with structures and content decisions
specifically geared toward search engines. We pay attention to how they rank us,
what technical rules they've changed from era to era, and we react when they
flag issues--not in our sites, but in how those sites are crawled.

The landscape of search is now shifting dramatically and in real time.

The advent of the consumer AI age is changing how we engage with the web. Some
bring their questions directly to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT,
avoiding the web search entirely. Natural language processing (NLP) and
personalization of these chat experiences means the user can ask questions and
then ask follow up questions with the same remembered context. They don't need
to format their queries to suit the engine. The model can adapt to them instead.

Others may still use a search engine like Google, but whereas the page list was
once the goal, now there are AI summaries right at the top. Why scroll down and
click when the information is right there?

These summaries, and the results we see from web-capable LLMs like ChatGPT, are
generated content and curation being performed by the models. In the case of the
search results summaries, these are very small, weak models, querying just the
top results in the search and summarizing. They have very little to guide the
model's *algorithmic reasoning* and might present untrustworthy sources just as
much as trustworthy ones. The larger models have some guidelines baked into
them, not at the AI model level itself, but wrapping it. Querying for health
information online will result in specific sites being searched, citing them.

This type of curation is fragile, though, and many searches can slip through the
cracks if phrased in the wrong way. Just like simple search summaries, it is
common to see information from sites like reddit make their way into your result
data, often to comical (or dangerous) results.

Regardless of the specifics of the AI mechanism the experience for the end user
has taken a dramatic shift. To stay relevant to the user's web experience the
engines are changing, and they're leaving behind the page rankings, paid search,
and SEO optimization rules. What this means for marketing will be the subject of
many articles and experiments, and is likely to change as companies like Google
scramble to ensure their revenue model can adjust.

What's more important in the short term are the ethical considerations. In the
healthcare sector we have a duty to provide accurate medical information. It's
baked into policy and regulation, but it's also at the heart of the businesses
themselves. With [some notable
exceptions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9339402/) the driving goal
of pharma is to find new and novel treatments to improve the lives of people.
Even for those entities in the business purely for profit maximization, lying
about health is a long term losing strategy.

In marketing our websites and ads must adhere to rigorous guidelines to ensure
they are accurate and balanced. Companies have internal medical, regulatory, and
legal teams with the mission of ensuring this compliance. The FDA watches the
line, ready to issue warnings where companies overstep, or to enter into
Corporate Integrity Agreement if they're especially naughty.

And for these reasons many companies are scared to touch AI. There isn't
complete control over the output of the content. What if something is
miscommunicated, or only a claim is presented without fair balance? What type of
liability does that create? When will the FDA provide guidance?

In the meantime, misinformation proliferates. In the absence of scientifically
accurate information published by a credible source, the vacuum of search will
be filled with the loudest voices. That might be the CDC or Mayo Clinic if
you're lucky. It might be reddit if you aren't.

Pharma has a duty to public health to engage in these channels. The more
medically accurate information we can push into the world, the more likely these
LLMs will train answers upon it. That could mean lives saved, injuries
prevented, and a growing culture of misinformation brought back on track in some
small way.

Marketing considerations aside--and there **will** be plenty of those as
well--we cannot wait to engage in these spaces, whether through structured data,
or content optimized for AI (bulleted lists, clear hierarchy, FAQs).

In summary, AI is making a big change in how search engines work, moving away
from traditional keyword searches to smart systems that understand what users
really mean, personalize results, and adapt to new ways of searching. This shift
makes the web experience easier and more efficient, but it also comes with
responsibilities. In areas like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, there is an
ethical duty to ensure that AI and large language models receive accurate,
trustworthy information, so users can make safe and informed decisions.
