In an earlier post I explained my approach to keycodes in AS3. If you're
looking for a hotkey system rather than a key sequence matching
solution, take a look at [destroytoday's][] [Hotkey][] project on
[github][]. It's very simple to use and piggybacks on Signals to make
the event listening easier. I may make some modifications to my own
keycode reader based on the very smart way he built his.
