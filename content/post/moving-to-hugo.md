It's been way too long since I've updated my labs blog, and that is sadly
for the dumbest of reasons: I broke my jekyll install. Somewhere along the
way I mixed things up and my ruby gems were all conflicting with one
another. Sure I could have fixed it, but who has the time for that?
Instead, I just wrote all my thoughts on gopher where the kewl kids hang.

I have some things I want to start sharing here again, so it's finally
time to dust this place off. I imported all my old content into hugo using
the very sexy command:

```bash
hugo import jekyll old_site new_site
```

It worked!

I'm using the "Tale" theme, which I picked out in about 10 seconds from
the theme list since it looked fairly minimal. I may do some work on it in
the future, or I may not. That's the _theme_ of this joint, after all.

More to come!
