I've been kicking around an idea that comments--public feedback systems in
general--are not helpful to the development of social systems. The scope
of my thinking is fairly limited to online media like blogs, social
networks, and media sharing, but it may hold some truth beyond the digital
boundaries as well.

When you read something noteworthy online, what drives you to interact
with it? I have identified a few triggers that are related to the original
content and not to another comment:

- I want to show my appreciation for the post
- I want to show my disagreement with the post
- I want to add my own opinion on the topic in the post
- I want to correct something in the post
- I want to make a joke

Are my reasons for commenting oriented toward the author or do I want to
add my voice for everyone else to see? Am I trying to start a discussion?

When a comment isn't for the author this is where things fall apart. The
comment is an attempt to hijack attention from the original content and
turn it into something else. There is no true ownership anymore. We also
find the typical trouble with anonymity creep into existence.

What would the internet look like without comments? We'd have a swath of
creators out there working in their own little space. If you have feedback
for them or a correction or anything else from that list above then you
reach out via email with your message. It is intended for the author
primarily.

Perhaps you have something you want to share with the world? Well now you
have a choice. You can email the author with your comment and ask that she
update her post with your information. Or, you could write your own post
and reference hers as the original. Or, you could author your own post and
email her to notify her of your thoughts, giving her the ability to add
a link to the follow-up discussion.

In all these situations the conversations are personal. There is an
inherited respect of the medium of communication. There's an opportunity
for actual dialogue, not just pile-ons.

That's my old-man rant for the day. What do you think about it? Have
something you agree with or disagree with in my post above? Want to add to
the conversation? Have a silly joke? How will you engage with me?
