In the early 70's, [my dad][] was a student at [Kent State
University][]. You may be familiar with the school from a [little][]
[incident][] [that][] [happened][] during the Vietnam War. During his
time there as an art student, he designed a logo for the Visual
Communications department for a project, as can be seen above. We used
to have a copy of the finished logo design hanging on one of the walls
in our house when I was growing up, and it brought up conversations on a
few occasions. The most interesting part of the design to me was the
font he created to do the lettering under the logo. These were the 70's,
folks. Font's weren't things you downloaded and installed back then.
They were done with rulers, compasses, and [rapidographs][]. Pretty
impressive, no?

Well, this ain't the 70's no more, son. and while his font is awesome,
it's not something he can use on his business cards or letterhead, let
alone the family newsletter / Christmas card. That, my friends, is
totally unacceptable. So I decided a while ago that I was going to
convert it to a true-type font for him. I never had the time to do it
before, but with the recent unemployment I decided to give it a go.
After a solid day of learning the in's and out's of font creation, I
have a reasonably usable draft of the font. I say draft for two reasons:
First, the font is based on the hand-drawn draft used in his logo
design. The lines aren't completely uniform, the verticals on the "m"
aren't quite centered, you get the idea. Second, my implementation of it
is really rough. The weights aren't balanced, the kerning is really
basic, and some of the characters are just shoddily made. Still, it's a
strong start. Take a look:

I intend on cleaning this version up a little bit (redrawing the Z,
centering some things better, fixing some weights), but I'm going to
keep it imperfect to a point. The font family "Tomasino" will always
have the "Draft" face available to represent the original. Only after
that's all done will I go back and create a beautifully perfect vector
version, as my dad surely intended his drawing to represent. This will
form the eventual "Regular" face.

Who knows when I'll have the time to finish it all, so I thought I'd
better share what I made so far. Look forward to seeing part 2 of this
post someday in the distant future.
