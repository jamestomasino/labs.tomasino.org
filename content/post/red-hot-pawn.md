I play a lot of chess. In fact, I play so much, I almost accidentally
capitalized the word "chess" a moment ago. Yup, I have a problem.

The site where I play chess online is called [Red Hot Pawn][1]. They
have mirror sites like [Chess@Work][] and the like for those who are
offended by Red Hots, I presume.

Anyway, I digress. I thought about what an actual "Red Hot Pawn" might
look like and decided to make one. Maybe I should send it to them?

I started by using a [smoke & fire generator][] that [Grant Skinner][]
made. If I recall (this was all a while back), the classes were Flex
based for no good reason, so I did a bit of editing and made a simpler
interface for it.
